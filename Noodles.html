        While boiling, open up the noodles and collect the condiment that
        follows the noodles separately

        Then add a small unit of groundnut oil to blend with the boiling water,
        then introduce the sliced onions, let both steam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to boil for like 3min, then inroduce the noodles into the boil
        water and reduce the heat and cover for additional 2-3min, by this time,
        the noodle can be turned to ensure the steam circulate as expected.
      </li>
