      <li>Garri (either whilte or Yellow)</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Spatula (Omo orogun, in Yoruba)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Procedures to making the Eba as follows:</h2>
    <p>
      Follow the following procedure in sequential order to achieve a smooth Eba
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get a quantity of water and boil</li>
      <li>
        When boil, share the water in ratio 80:20, to cater for the need of
        water after
      </li>
      <li>collect the 80% of the water and then apply the Garri</li>
      <li>
        While applying the garri, that should not be in a rush or much, rather
        in smooth flowing small quantity, till it fully circulate the water and
        with a very little water on the surface to make room for turning
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly turn the garri till it give a little stiffness to avail room for
        testing the tenderness of the stature
      </li>
      <li>Once it hit the taste of our texture, we are done in the making</li>
      <li>
        Also, in the case their is lump (koko) in the eba, this is the part
        where the 20% reserve water come to play to achieve the desire
        smoothness
      </li>
      <li>
        Once this is to our personal taste, then we can serve with our favourite
        vegetable and Egusi (optional) to garnish it with assorted beef and
        Protein
